  <h1>Get Organized</h1>
  <p>In writing, process is everything. It starts in the research phase. At the beginning of the week, set achievable goals for each day of the week. You can also include things you'll need to use for researching. For example:
  </p>
  <ol>
<li>Monday: Freewrite everything you think you know about submarines for 20 minutes. Then, go to the library and read about them and their historical significance (1-2 hr). If needed, conduct more research online. Materials: library card, notebook, pencils, eraser, book bag.</li>
<li>Tuesday: Decide on the time period that fits the story idea. Begin researching online (2-3 hr). Order books at the library or bookstore.</li>
  </ol>
