You'll find that it's one of the most important--and enjoyable--parts of your process. This website this provide you the tools you need to:

    <title>Get Organized</title>

         <p>In writing, process is everything. It starts in the research phase. At the beginning of the week, set achievable goals for each day of the week. You can also include things you'll need to use for researching. For example:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Monday: Freewrite everything you think you know about submarines for 20 minutes. Then, go to the library and read about them and their historical significance (1-2 hr). If needed, conduct more research online. Materials: library card, notebook, pencils, eraser, book bag. </li>
    <li>Tuesday: Decide on the time period that fits the story idea. Begin researching online (2-3 hr). Order books at the library or bookstore. </li>
    <ol>

    <p>To understand your time period, it is best to read books, study photographs (if applicable), and go into archives. If there's a museum that contains objects of interest to your story, go there. Travel to the location where your story takes place to get sensory details, which will draw your reader in. </p>

    <title>Conduct Meaningful Interviews</title>   
  </head>
         <p> In order to conduct meaningful interviews, you need to reflect on what you still want to know after you've done all the preliminary research. Make sure you are clear with yourself on your goals. Interviews can be wonderful opportunities to get family stories--but check in with your interviewee in advance to see if they are comfortable sharing! </p>
