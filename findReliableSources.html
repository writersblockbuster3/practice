  <h1>Find Reliable Sources</h1>
  <p>To understand your time period, it is best to read books, study photographs (if applicable), and go into archives. If there's a museum that contains objects of interest to your story, go there. Travel to the location where your story takes place to get sensory details, which will draw your reader in.</p>
